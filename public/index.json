How to remember Cohesion?: Use a story: I and my COmpanion are the same. The “CO” in Cohesion is the same as the “CO” in Companion. Adhesion Adhesion is the attraction of molecules of different substances. Way to remember Adhesions?: I use ADhesive tape. You usually use tape to attach two different things together. Another example is: water sticking to a window. The water is sticking to the glass, these are two different substances attracted to each other. Van der Waals force Van der Waals force is the slight attraction that develops between oppositly charged regions of molecules. How to remember Van der Waals force: Two oppositly charged molecules attract to each other, like a magnet. (+ and –) The more molecules that are close to each other, the more Van der Waals force Polar covalent bond A polar covalent bond is the uneven sharing of elections between two atoms. How to remember A polar covalent bond?: A story: Santa unevenly shared the presents. Santa lives in the North “Pole.” Non-polar covalent bond A Non-polar covalent bond is the equal sharing of elections between two atoms. How to remember Nonpolar covalent bonds?: Santa shares his presents equally. Remember this vocab word by knowing the opposite (Santa unevenly shared the presents (polar covalent bond)). Monomers of PNCL A Protein\u0026rsquo;s monomer is Amino acids, Nucleic acids is Nucleotides, Carbohydrates is Monosaccharide, and Lipids is Glycerol with a Fatty Acid How to remember? Proteins: A mean Cow. Cows have lots of protein. A mean sounds like Amino. Nucleic Acids: Nucleo is written the same as Nucleic. Carbohydrates: Knowing the simpler meaning of monosaccharides, one sugar, can be easier to remember. Lipids: Guys are fat. Glycerol starts with Guys. Fat is the same as Fatty Acid CHONS, PONCH, CHO, CHO!!!! Chons Carbon, hydogen, oxygen, nitrogen,sulfur. Ponch phosphorus, oxygen, Nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen. Cho carbon, hydrogen, oxygen. How to know the order of the elements are listed in CHONS PONCH CHO CHO! And you can remember PNCL. You can remember this by PNC Park with L for looser. Chons-Protein Ponch-Nitrogen Cho-carbs cho-Lipids. Saturated/Unsaturated fatty acid Saturated fatty acids are acids full of Hydrogen atoms, and unsaturated is not full of hydrogens What is a substrate? A substrate is the compound that the enzyme reacts with at the active site\nWhat is the Lock-and-key and induced-fit model?? The lock-and-key model states that the active site of an enzyme only fits a specific substrate. The induced-fit model sates the active site will change its shape to fit their substrate\nWhat factors effect enzymes? Temparature, pH, and pressure are all factors that can effect an enzyme\nWhat is a reactant? A reactant is an element or compund that enters a chemical rxn\nWhat is a product?? A product is a element or compund produced by a chemical rxn\nWhat is the denaturing of a enzyme?? A enzyme is denatured when its shape is changed making them non-functional\nWhat do hydrogen bonds do? Hydrogen atom bonds occur when a hydrogen atom covalently (share an electron) bonds to a oxygen or nitrogen atom\nCovalent and ionic bonds? A covelent bond occurs when two atoms each with one electron both need an atom so they share the electron. A ionic bond occurs when a electron is transfered from one atom to another\nWhat does atomos mean? It means \u0026ldquo;unable to be cut\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is biochemistry? Biochemistry is the study of all compunds containing carbon\npH? The pH of a solution depends on the concentration of H+ ions in that solution. The solution is acidic when it has a lot of H+ ions and is basic when it has more OH- ions?\n","permalink":"https://tigertutoringtool.aamira.me/tinker/biochemistry/","summary":"Vocab Cohesion/Adhesion Cohesion is the attraction of molecules of the same substance.
