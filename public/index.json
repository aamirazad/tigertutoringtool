( Fun fact the town is located between Milan and Venice Italy.)\nWhat is the relationship between the two households? In lines 26-27 of Act 1 Scene 1, Sampras\u0026rsquo;s statement reveals the relationships between the two households.\nWhat does Shakespeare mean by “Star-crossed lovers”? People who believe in Astrology believe that the stars control human destiny. Another word for Starcrossed is frustrated with the stars.\nWhat happens to the lovers?\nLine 8 of the Prologue reveals what happens.\nWhat is the subject matter of this play?\nSubject matter means what happens in the play. Base your response on what you learn in the prologue.\nWhat does the chorus ask of the audience in the last two lines?\nToward the end of the prologue, the prologue asks the audience to do two things. (hint the prologue doesn’t directly mention the audience).\nWhat is the name of the poetic form Shakespeare uses for the Prologue? How many lines are there?\nThe type of poetic form is one that uses a pattern of ABABABCDCD…\nList examples of poetic language.\nIn the Prologue, there four are used. When looking at the different poetic languages look for words that mean something different, rhymes, and patterns.\nExplain what you learn from the Prologue about the fate of Romeo and Juliet and the feud between the two families.\nDivide the prologue into two parts. Learning about Romeo and Juliet\u0026rsquo;s fate: Lines 6-10. The two families feud: lines 1-5.\nWhat is the primary purpose of the Prologue to the play?\nIf you like civics, ask yourself what is the purpose of the preamble of the constitution. Then apply it to this. If you are not a civics person, think of the prologue as a playbill. If you have ever been to a play, what does the playbill show you?\nAct 1, Scene 1\nThe first scene of every Shakespeare tragedy was planned to get the attention of the groundlings, people of the lower classes who stood in the pit to watch the plays. Why might Scene 1 have appealed to the groundlings? This is a picture of groundlings (people standing below the stage). The groundlings had a front-row view. Ask yourself, what would you like to see close up, especially from the first scene? This can be opinionated but put yourself back in Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s day, and assume what the average person would like to see.\nWhich words in the stage directions in line 44 clarify that Sampson is not speaking to Abram. Stage directions are often at the beginning or end of the poems.\nWith which family are the quarreling servants affiliated?\nYou can use clues from how the characters act or what they say, or you can look at the cast.\nTybalt’s name comes from the word that means “bold.” Benvolio is from Latin words that mean, “I wish” and “well.” From what you know about them so far, how appropriate are their names?\nThe best example is when the two characters enter into a fight with the servants. Tybalt acts differently than Benvolio. Search in the play where the two characters enter the scene, and analyze how each reacts to the fight.\n","permalink":"https://tigertutoringtool.aamira.me/basenback/romeo-juliet/","summary":"Prologue-\nWhat is the place and setting of the play?

How to remember Cohesion?: Use a story: I and my COmpanion are the same. The “CO” in Cohesion is the same as the “CO” in Companion. Adhesion Adhesion is the attraction of molecules of different substances. Way to remember Adhesions?: I use ADhesive tape. You usually use tape to attach two different things together. Another example is: water sticking to a window. The water is sticking to the glass, these are two different substances attracted to each other. Van der Waals force Van der Waals force is the slight attraction that develops between oppositly charged regions of molecules. How to remember Van der Waals force: Two oppositly charged molecules attract to each other, like a magnet. (+ and –) The more molecules that are close to each other, the more Van der Waals force Polar covalent bond A polar covalent bond is the uneven sharing of elections between two atoms. How to remember A polar covalent bond?: A story: Santa unevenly shared the presents. Santa lives in the North “Pole.” Non-polar covalent bond A Non-polar covalent bond is the equal sharing of elections between two atoms. How to remember Nonpolar covalent bonds?: Santa shares his presents equally. Remember this vocab word by knowing the opposite (Santa unevenly shared the presents (polar covalent bond)). Monomers of PNCL A Protein\u0026rsquo;s monomer is Amino acids, Nucleic acids is Nucleotides, Carbohydrates is Monosaccharide, and Lipids is Glycerol with a Fatty Acid How to remember? Proteins: A mean Cow. Cows have lots of protein. A mean sounds like Amino. Nucleic Acids: Nucleo is written the same as Nucleic. Carbohydrates: Knowing the simpler meaning of monosaccharides, one sugar, can be easier to remember. Lipids: Guys are fat. Glycerol starts with Guys. Fat is the same as Fatty Acid CHONS, PONCH, CHO, CHO!!!! Chons Carbon, hydogen, oxygen, nitrogen,sulfur. Ponch phosphorus, oxygen, Nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen. Cho carbon, hydrogen, oxygen. How to know the order of the elements are listed in CHONS PONCH CHO CHO! And you can remember PNCL. You can remember this by PNC Park with L for looser. Chons-Protein Ponch-Nitrogen Cho-carbs cho-Lipids. Saturated/Unsaturated fatty acid Saturated fatty acids are acids full of Hydrogen atoms, and unsaturdated is not full of hydrogens What is a substrate? A substrate is the compound that the enzyme reacts with at the active site\nWhat is the Lock-and-key and induced-fit model?? The lock-and-key model states that the active site of an enzyme only fits a specific substrate. The induced-fit model sates the active site will change its shape to fit their substrate\nWhat factors effect enzymes? Temparature, pH, and pressure are all factors that can effect an enzyme\nWhat is a reactant? A reactant is an element or compund that enters a chemical rxn\nWhat is a product?? A product is a element or compund produced by a chemical rxn\nWhat is the denaturing of a enzyme?? A enzyme is denatured when its shape is changed making them non-functional\nWhat do hydrogen bonds do? Hydrogen atom bonds occur when a hydrogen atom covalently (share an electron) bonds to a oxygen or nitrogen atom\nCovalent and ionic bonds? A covelent bond occurs when two atoms each with one electron both need an atom so they share the electron. A ionic bond occurs when a electron is transfered from one atom to another\nWhat does atomos mean? It means \u0026ldquo;unable to be cut\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is biochemistry? Biochemistry is the study of all compunds containing carbon\npH? The pH of a solution depends on the concentration of H+ ions in that solution. The solution is acidic when it has a lot of H+ ions and is basic when it has more OH- ions?\n","permalink":"https://tigertutoringtool.aamira.me/tinker/biochemistry/","summary":"Vocab Cohesion/Adhesion Cohesion is the attraction of molecules of the same substance.
