## Vocab

* **What is Cohesion/Adhesion?** Chohesion is the attraction between molecules of the same substance. Adhesion is attraction of molecules of diffrent substances.

* **What is Van der Waals force?** There is a slight attraction between oppositly charged regions of atrracion. Think gecko

* **What is the polar covalent bond?** Two atoms are sharing electrons. They are pulling on that electron equally

* **What is a non-polar covalent bond?** When two atoms are sharing a electron, one has more protons so they pull on that electron more than others

* What are the monomers of PNCL? The four monomers is amino acid, nucleotides, monosaccharide, and glycerol (combined with a fatty acid)

* PNCL Park macromolecules are made of what elements? CHONS: Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Sulfer; PONCH: phosphorus, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen; CHO:: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen

* Saturated/Unsaturaed fatty acid? In a saturated fatty acid, saturated does not have any double bonds meaning it can hold as many hydrogen it can. Unsaturated has a dobule bond

* What is a substrate? A substrate is the compound that the enzyme reacts with at the active site

* What is the Lock-and-key and induced-fit model?? The lock-and-key model states that the active site of an enzyme only fits a specific substrate. The induced-fit model sates the active site will change its shape to fit their substrate

* What factors effect enzymes? Temparature, pH, and pressure are all factors that can effect an enzyme

* What is a reactant? A reactant is an element or compund that enters a chemical rxn

* What is a product?? A product is a element or compund produced by a chemical rxn

* What is the denaturing of a enzyme?? A enzyme is denatured when its shape is changed making them non-functional

* What do hydrogen bonds do? Hydrogen atom bonds occur when a hydrogen atom covalently (share an electron) bonds to a oxygen or nitrogen atom

* Covalent and ionic bonds? A covelent bond occurs when two atoms each with one electron both need an atom so they share the electron. A ionic bond occurs when a electron is transfered from one atom to another

* What does atomos mean? It means "unable to be cut"

* What is biochemistry? Biochemistry is the study of all compunds containing carbon

* pH? The pH of a solution depends on the concentration of H+ ions in that solution. The solution is acidic when it has a lot of H+ ions and is basic when it has more OH- ions?
