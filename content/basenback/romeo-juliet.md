What does the chorus ask of the audience in the last two lines?

What is the name of the poetic form Shakespeare uses for the Prologue? How many lines are there?

List examples of poetic language.

In the Prologue, there four are used. When looking at the different poetic languages look for words that mean something different, rhymes, and patterns. 

Explain what you learn from the Prologue about the fate of Romeo and Juliet and the feud between the two families. 

Divide the prologue into two parts. Learning about Romeo and Juliet's fate: Lines 6-10. The two families feud: lines 1-5. 

What is the primary purpose of the Prologue to the play? 

If you like civics, ask yourself what is the purpose of the preamble of the constitution. Then apply it to this. If you are not a civics person, think of the prologue as a playbill. If you have ever been to a play, what does the playbill show you? 


Act 1, Scene 1

The first scene of every Shakespeare tragedy was planned to get the attention of the groundlings, people of the lower classes who stood in the pit to watch the plays. Why might Scene 1 have appealed to the groundlings? 
 This is a picture of groundlings (people standing below the stage) (here is a cool website on groundlings: https://libapps.libraries.uc.edu/exhibits/shakespeare400/2015/09/24/184/). The groundlings had a front-row view. Ask yourself, what would you like to see close up, especially from the first scene? This can be opinionated but put yourself back in Shakespeare's day, and assume what the average person would like to see. 

Which words in the stage directions in line 44 clarify that Sampson is not speaking to Abram. 
Stage directions are often at the beginning or end of the poems.

With which family are the quarreling servants affiliated? 

You can use clues from how the characters act or what they say, or you can look at the cast. 

Tybalt’s name comes from the word that means “bold.” Benvolio is from Latin words that mean, “I wish” and “well.” From what you know about them so far, how appropriate are their names? 

The best example is when the two characters enter into a fight with the servants. Tybalt acts differently than Benvolio. Search in the play where the two characters enter the scene, and analyze how each reacts to the fight.
