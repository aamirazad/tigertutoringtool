## Prologue

*What more do we learn about the story from the Prologue in Act 2?*

Look at lines 767, 768, and 774. These give the main picture but examine the results better. If you're still stuck ask for help from a teacher, or fix your answer after you have read through the story. 

## Scene 1

*What does Romeo mean by “He jests at scars that never felt a wound”?*

Sheesh Romeo that's harsh. Romeo is overhearing this conversation about him. It is alos an example of dramatic irony! Analyse the text, jest means to make fun of. Also what wounds are he refering too? What problem is/was Romeo talking about? 

*Why is it ironic that Mercutio teases Romeo about Rosaline?*

What do we know about irony? Irony is often when something happens that we do not expect to happen, i.e. if I am a proffesional car driver it would be ironic for me to crash. So, when Mercutio is making fun of Romeo for being love sick with Rosaline (BTW: Rosaline is pronounced: Roz-uh-line), what can we infer when we know what Romeo beleives. Want to find out more about Rosaline? There is a movie about ROsaline (Watch on hulu with parent permission, or check out this website: [Rosaline's appearence in Romeo & Juliet](https://nosweatshakespeare.com/characters/rosaline-romeo-juliet/)

## Scene 2

*Explain the metaphor that Romeo uses to describe Juliet when he first sees her. how does this figure of speech reveal his feeling about her.*

Romeo compares Juliet to this stellar star. What does that star do to the world. People often compare the night to sadness, so what would the star do. 

*According to Romeo, who is Jealous of Juliets beauty?*

This is another stellar sphere. 

*What does Juliet want Romeo to do before she realizes he is there?* 

This is a tricky question. The next question will make this question more clear. Think, what is the main problem in this story? What would fix all of these problems? Still need help? Ask a teacher! Teachers are your best resource! 

*Explain Juliet's speech about the importance of names. What does "wherefore art thou" actually mean?*

The importance of names is a tricky subject. What do you think Juliet means? What is the main theme of this story? "Deny thy father and refuse thy name.."(Shakespeare 2.2. 860). This is my favorite line (-Michael). You may think that wherefore art thou may be asking, wherefore be that Romeo. But no, shakespeare makes it weird. Think of the first part of this question, and apply it to this question. 

*How does Romeo claim he was able to get over the orchard walls? Why is Romeo unafraid of Juliets Kinsmen? 

Romeo claims this Roman Romeo helped Romeo get over the walls (say that five times fast!). Romeo is unafraid because of what? What do you think is on Romeo's mind, instead of fear?

*Who, according to what Romeo tell Juliet, gave him directions to her balcony?* 

Romeo is big on this topic. 

*How does Juliet indicate that she may doubt Romeo's love for her? Find two quotes that she is testing him.* 

Juliet goes straight to the point by asking what? Also she compares their love to this natural occurence. 

*Why does Juliet tell Romeo not to "swear by the moon?"*

What does the moon do every night? What to learn more about our moon check out this website: [The Earth's Moon](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/).

*Who mentions the idea of marriage first? What is your reaction to this proposal?*

Who is most confident about this relationship? This is a cool question! What do you think? What would you do? 

*Explain the line "Parting is such sweet sorrow." What is this an example of?* 

This may seem complicated but you got this! Apply this to real life. What if you and your friend were having dinner, and you really like eating with them. But, you guys are going to a waterpark tomorrow! How would you feel if you had to leave dinner? Look in your notes for the second half! Hint: Sweet + // sorrow -. 

*Explain the role that darkness plays in helping Romeo and Juliet learn of thier love for each other* 

The role of darkness is a key factor. If you are playing hide and seek what factor would darkness play? Also Romeo wants to stay as long as he can, how does the darkness help? 

## Scene 3

*What is Friar Lawrence doing at the beginning of scene three?* 

Friar Lawrence talks about a basket and different plants. What do you think he is doing? 

*Find and define examples of personification in the first six lines of Friar Lawrence's speech.* 

Use your notes to define personification. Also look in the first six lines and find words that relate to nature, and then something a human would do. 

*Who does Friar Lawerence think Romeo has been with all night?* 

Friar Lawerence has been left out of the group chat with this one. Since he doesn't know the details what do you think he beleives Romeo loves? 

*What does Romeo ask Friar Lawrence to do?* 

Look back at what Romeo asked Juliet for? 

*Why does Friar Lawerence question Romeo's request*

Remeber, he has been out of the loop. So he thinks that Romeo's past lover and him are still together. Also Romeo has been very upset about this her too. 

*What is Friar Lawerence's reason for agreeing ot marry Romeo and Juliet?* 

Friar Lawrence is a man of peace. What would he disagree with between the two families. How might this union help the family's and their relationship. 

## Scene 4

*What news does Benvolio tell Mercutio at the beginning of scene 4?* 

Look only at Benvolio's speech throughtout the first half of the story. What did Benvolio say that Mercutio not know about? 

*Why does Mercutio Romeo is already dead?* 

Think of what Romeo has been suffering from. 

*How is Mercutio a dramatic foil to Romeo* 

Compare the two characters. Ask, who started the fight, who makes suggestive comments, who is being defensive? 

*The Montague Boys think Romeo was still with Rosaline last night. Why do you think Romeo doesn't tell them the truth* 

Two lovers from different families, whos families fight all the time. Why wouldn't you want them to know the truth? 

*Who teases the Nurse and Why?*

Now this is just plain mean. Look at who starts the teasing, and look into who is from which family. 

*What does Romeo want the Nurse to have Juliet do?* 

Romeo comes up with this big plan. The first step of his plan is for Juliet to get to the church. What is her excuse for going to church? Also, after the fact, what weird thing does Romeo request? Hint: what does "A tackled stair" mean?
