10. *What is the primary purpose of the Prologue to the play?*

If you like civics, ask yourself what is the purpose of the preamble of the constitution. Then apply it to this. If you are not a civics person, think of the prologue as a playbill. If you have ever been to a play, what does the playbill show you? 


## Act 1, Scene 1

1. *The first scene of every Shakespeare tragedy was planned to get the attention of the groundlings, people of the lower classes who stood in the pit to watch the plays. Why might Scene 1 have appealed to the groundlings?*
![groundlings](https://tigertutoringtool.aamira.me/images/groundlings.jpg)

This is a picture of groundlings (people standing below the stage). The groundlings had a front-row view. Ask yourself, what would you like to see close up, especially from the first scene? This can be opinionated but put yourself back in Shakespeare's day, and assume what the average person would like to see. 


2. *Which words in the stage directions in line 44 clarify that Sampson is not speaking to Abram?* 

Stage directions are often at the beginning or end of the poems.

3. *With which family are the quarreling servants affiliated?* 

You can use clues from how the characters act or what they say, or you can look at the cast. 

4. *Tybalt’s name comes from the word that means “bold.” Benvolio is from Latin words that mean, “I wish” and “well.” From what you know about them so far, how appropriate are their names?* 

The best example is when the two characters enter into a fight with the servants. Tybalt acts differently than Benvolio. Search in the play where the two characters enter the scene, and analyze how each reacts to the fight. 

5. *Summarize the warning that the Prince issues to the Monatgues and Capulets in this speech. Why is he so upset?*

Look for stage cues, revealing the answer. 

7. *What does this conversation reveal about Romeo's state of mind?*

Romeo uses a lot of euphemisms (Oxford Languages: a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt when referring to something unpleasant or embarrassing). These euphemisms can reveal some of his state of mind. Still need help? Look for keywords such as I, or she to show his state of mind. 

*What is an Oxymoron?* 

Check Notes. 

8. *What reason for his sadness does Benvolio give to Romeo about the woman he loves?*

Romeo mentions this many times. Hint: In Elizabethan England being pure was very important. 

9. *What advice does Benvolio give to Romeo about the woman he loves?* 

You can connect Benvolio's advice to what his name means ("I wish" and "well") He is very relaxed, with simple solutions that aren't thought of quickly. Romeo has a negative reaction to Benvolio's statement. 

## Act 1, Scene 2

10. *Why does Capulet's servant talk to Romeo and Benvolio?*
