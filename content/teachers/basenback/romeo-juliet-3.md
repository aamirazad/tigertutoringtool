## Scene 1

1. *In the discussion between Benvolio and Mercutio at the beginning of scene one, what do you suppose the talk of quick tempers and the hot day foreshadows?  What specifically might the audience be anticipating next?*

Think about what people do when they have quick tempers. Since it's a hot day everyone is kinda mad and just wants to let their anger out. Also, notice what Mercutio is trying to do to Benvolio. He is making Benvolio mad and ready to fight with him.

2. *What is Romeo’s response to Tybalt’s challenge?*

Romeo's response, along with just trying to tell Tybalt no, goes deeper as to tell Tybalt that Romeo and Tybalt are like family. We know this is true since Romeo got married to Juliet but nobody else knows this.

3. *Since Mercutio doesn’t know of Romeo’s marriage, what is his opinion of Romeo’s response?*

Look at what Mercutio says. He thinks Romeo is being chicken for not fighting Tybalt. He sees no reason to run away from this fight.
