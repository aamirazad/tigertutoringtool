## Scene 1

1. *In the discussion between Benvolio and Mercutio in the beginning of scene one, what do you suppose the talk of quick tempers and the hot day foreshadows?  What specifically might the audience be anticipating next?*

Think about what people do when they have quick tempers. Since its a hot day everyone is kinda mad and just wants to let there anger out. Also notice what Mercuito is trying to do to Benvolio. He is making Benvolio mad and ready to fight with him.

2. *What is Romeo’s response to Tybalt’s challenge?*

Romeo's responce, along with just trying to tell Tybalt no, goes deeper as to tell Tybalt that Romeo and Tybalt are like family. We know this is true since Romeo got married to Juliet but nobody else knows this.
