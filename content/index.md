## All my notes for some reason

Thats right, almost all my school notes are published for anyone to see. I have put an incredible amount of time into this website. Keep it alive by [purchasing](https://buy.stripe.com/bIY00r4hm12H3ao8ww) Tigertutoringtool

This site has a long of changes from the old site. Mainly, this is a copy of my school [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. This means links are heavly used in this vault. Links show up like this one to [[Hamlet]]. This will also create a connection in the graph you can see in the top right corner. The exporer in the right functions slightly weridly. Clicking on the name of a folder opens what is called a folder note. Usually the folder note will just show a list of files in that folder. Sometimes, I want to write information in the folder note and when that happens, unfotunatly because of technicalitys, this means the list of folders is duplicated. What is important is links to folders do not work in these folder notes so you will have to manually navigate to the folder using the explorer in the right. I do recomend using the folder notes though, cause for example, in [[10th-Grade/History/Reformation/]] I give a brief overview of the content with key points. 

For now, use the explorer on the right to navigate to your class. If you are looking for a specific topic, use the search bar in the top right.
