## Vocab

Cohesion/Adhesion
: Cohesion is the attraction of molecules of the same substance. How to remember Cohesion?: Use a story: I and my COmpanion are the same. The “CO” in Cohesion is the same as the “CO” in Companion.

Adhesion
: Adhesion is the attraction of molecules of different substances. Way to remember Adhesions?: I use ADhesive tape. You usually use tape to attach two different things together. Another example is: water sticking to a window. The water is sticking to the glass, these are two different substances attracted to each other.


Van der Waals force
: Van der Waals force is the slight attraction that develops between oppositly charged regions of molecules. How to remember Van der Waals force: Two oppositly charged molecules attract to each other, like a magnet. (+ and –) The more molecules that are close to each other, the more Van der Waals force

Polar covalent bond
: A polar covalent bond is the uneven sharing of elections between two atoms. How to remember A polar covalent bond?: A story: Santa unevenly shared the presents. Santa lives in the North “Pole.”

Non-polar covalent bond
: A Non-polar covalent bond is the equal sharing of elections between two atoms. How to remember Nonpolar covalent bonds?: Santa shares his presents equally. Remember this vocab word by knowing the opposite (Santa unevenly shared the presents (polar covalent bond)).

Monomers of PNCL
: A Protein's monomer is Amino acids, Nucleic acids is Nucleotides, Carbohydrates is Monosaccharide, and Lipids is Glycerol with a Fatty Acid

How to remember?
: Proteins: A mean Cow. Cows have lots of protein. A mean sounds like Amino. 
Nucleic Acids: Nucleo is written the same as Nucleic. 
Carbohydrates: Knowing the simpler meaning of monosaccharides, one sugar, can be easier to remember.
Lipids: Guys are fat. Glycerol starts with Guys. Fat is the same as Fatty Acid

### CHONS, PONCH, CHO, CHO!!!!
Chons
: Carbon, hydogen, oxygen, nitrogen,sulfur.

Ponch
: phosphorus, oxygen, Nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen.

Cho
: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen.

How to know the order of the elements are listed in 
: CHONS PONCH CHO CHO! And you can remember PNCL. You can remember this by PNC Park with L for looser. Chons-Protein Ponch-Nitrogen Cho-carbs cho-Lipids.

Saturated/Unsaturated fatty acid
: Saturated fatty acids are acids full of Hydrogen atoms, and unsaturated is not full of hydrogens

* What is a substrate? A substrate is the compound that the enzyme reacts with at the active site

* What is the Lock-and-key and induced-fit model?? The lock-and-key model states that the active site of an enzyme only fits a specific substrate. The induced-fit model sates the active site will change its shape to fit their substrate

* What factors effect enzymes? Temparature, pH, and pressure are all factors that can effect an enzyme

* What is a reactant? A reactant is an element or compund that enters a chemical rxn

* What is a product?? A product is a element or compund produced by a chemical rxn

* What is the denaturing of a enzyme?? A enzyme is denatured when its shape is changed making them non-functional

* What do hydrogen bonds do? Hydrogen atom bonds occur when a hydrogen atom covalently (share an electron) bonds to a oxygen or nitrogen atom

* Covalent and ionic bonds? A covelent bond occurs when two atoms each with one electron both need an atom so they share the electron. A ionic bond occurs when a electron is transfered from one atom to another

* What does atomos mean? It means "unable to be cut"

* What is biochemistry? Biochemistry is the study of all compunds containing carbon

* pH? The pH of a solution depends on the concentration of H+ ions in that solution. The solution is acidic when it has a lot of H+ ions and is basic when it has more OH- ions?
