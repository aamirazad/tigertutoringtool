## What is it

Tigertutoringtool is a student developed and made website to help other Hollidaysburg Area School District students understand concepts taught in their classes. It can also be used as a reference for general knowledge, though some articles are written more specifically for students taking the same class as me. A copy of my personal notes, this class also can be used in the future to find notes from a topic taught in the years past. 


## Didn't this already exist

A complete rewrite (of the code) from the earlier site built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), this time with [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). It is now directly synced with my [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault which contains all my notes. Right now, I published all my notes from 10th grade and the few notes from 9th grade. I am working on integrating all the tigertutoringtool notes from 10th grade into my personal notes.
